      <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This course is the second of the two-semeter sequence for Ph.D. students in Sociology.  In this course, students will learn the statisical and computational principles neccesiary to perform modern, flexible, and creative analysis of quantiative social data.  This course hopes to transfrom students from consumers of quantative research to producers of it.</p>

<p>See the logistics page for more information about [inspirations], [software], [code conventions], [collaboration policy], [Piazza], and [prerequisites].</p>


      <h3>Goals</h3>
By the end of the semester, you will be able to:
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct, interpret, and communicate results from analysis using multiple regression (including dummy variables and interactions).</li>
        <li>Conduct, interpret, and communicate results from analysis using logistic regression (including dummy variables and interactions).</li>
        <li>Describe the relationship between multiple regression, logistic regression, and then generalized linear model.</li>
        <li>Write clean, reusable, and reliable R code.</li>
        <li>Build a solid, reproducible research pipeline to go from raw data to final paper.</li>
        <li>Feel empowered working with data.</li>
      </ul>

      Further, because we cannot possibly cover everything that you will need to know during your career as a researcher, there are two final long-term goals.  After this course is over, you will be able to:
      <ul>
        <li>Learn new statistics</li>
        <li>Learn new programing</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>There are three main types of assignments for students:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Preparing for class:</b> For many classes there will be some reading (or video watching) that you must do before class.  I expect you to come to class 100% prepared.  I will assign a reasonable amount of stuff, and you must do it.  I will not spend valuable class time summarizing readings that you should have done before class.  Rather, we are going to use class time for more valuable learning activities.</li>
  <li><b>Weekly homework:</b> Learning data analysis takes practice.  There will be weekly homework assignments, and these assigments are described in detail on the homework page.</li>
  <li><b>Replciation paper:</b> Students will replicate and extend a published paper.  This project is described in greater detail on the project page.</li>
</ul>
