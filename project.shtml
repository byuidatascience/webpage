    <h1>Replication and extension project</h1>

    <p>In this project, you will work with a partner to reproduce and extend a published research article. The primary goal of this project is to provide the raw materials for a publishable paper, which will be developed and written in the empirical seminar
      next year. The secondary goals of this project are to 1) give you practice learning new statistical material and computational techniques; 2) give you practice using good software engineering techniques; 3) give you practice doing collaborative
      research, something you will do throughout your career; 4) show you, in a way that no homework assignment can, the complexity and joy of doing real data analysis. This project not be without pain -- <a href="https://politicalsciencereplication.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/nightmare-after-nightmare-students-trying-to-replicate-work/">Nightmare after nightmare: students trying to replicate work</a>      -- but it will be worth it.
      <p>

        <p>For the project, you must follow the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> and meet certian <a href="#requirements">technical requirements</a>.</p>

        <p>Here are the five steps to the project:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="#pick">Pick a paper</a></li>
          <li><a href="#reproduce">Reproduce the results exactly</a></li>
          <li><a href="#peer1">Have your work reproduced by a peer and get feedback</a></li>
          <li><a href="#new">Do something new</a></li>
          <li><a href="#peer2">Have your work reproduced by a peer and get feedback</a></li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="pick">Pick a paper</h2>

        <p>You should pick a paper in an area that is interesting to you. Some people recommend that the paper be published recently and in a top journal in the field. Also, the paper should use methods related to those that we are going to learn in the course.</p>
        <p>Since this is the first time I’ve tried this project, I'm going to require that the paper you select has data already available. I don't want you to spend your time emailing with authors. That is not the kind of learning experience I’m hoping to create with this project. Also, I strongly recommend that you pick a paper where the code is already available. To be clear, you should not use this code. But, having this code available means that you should be able to ultimately reproduce
          the results in the published paper.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for papers to replicate here are some strategies that you could use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>browse examples of papers that have been replicated by students in the past: <a href="http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2001/data">dataverse for Harvard's Gov2001 course</a> and <a href="https://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/CambridgeReplication">dataverse for Combridge Replcation Workshop</a>.</li>
          <li>start with a large, public data set and look for papers that use it.  For example, here are lists of papers that use <a href="http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/publications">Add Health</a> and <a href="http://crcw.princeton.edu/publications/publications.asp">Fragile Families</a>.</li>
           <li>browse data archives.  Some examples are: <a href="http://dataverse.org/">dataverse</a>, <a href="http://isps.yale.edu/research/data">ISPS data archive</a>, <a href="http://opr.princeton.edu/archive/">OPR data archive</a>, <a href="http://www.tessexperiments.org/previousstudies.html">TESS</a>, and <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/">ICPSR</a>.</li>
           <li>think about papers that you have read in your classes that you really enjoyed (or thought were wrong).</li>
           <li>Talk to your advisor, advanced graduate students, and your classmates.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When picking a paper it may be hard for you to tell if the methods will be far beyond what will be covered in class.  When in doubt, post a question to Piazza.</p>

        <h2 id="reproduce">Reproduce the results exactly</h2>

        <p>You should be able to re-create every table and graph in the paper. At this point, however, you should not spend to much time on layout.  So, if hte figure has a lengend on top and your legend is on the side that is fine, as long as the results clearly match.</p>

        <p>Begin your replication by creating a document with images of each table and each figure. Next, add the parts of the text where the authors describe how the results were generated. Finally, create code that reproduces the results. This document will be highly structured. For example,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Image of Table 1</li>
          <li>Text describing how Table 1 was created</li>
          <li>Your code to reproduce Table 1</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There does not need to be any theory or literature review in this document.  It is jsut about reproducing the results.</p>


        <h2 id="peer1">Have your duplication reproduced by a peer and receive feedback</h2>
        <p>Someone in the class will clone your repo and reproduce your reproduction.  Also, they will send you some <a href="#feedback">helpful feedback</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="new">Do something new</h2>
        <p>You should somehow extend or improve the paper you are reproducing. Here are some examples of how you could do that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>create different visualizations of their data and results.</li>
          <li>extend the analysis by using different methods or asking different questions.</li>
          <li>re-run the same analysis on completely different data.</li>
          <li>take an old paper and update the analysis with newer data.</li>
          <li>For other ideas on how to add value, see <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/paperspub.pdf">item 8 in King 2006</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="peer2">Have your work reproduced by a peer and receive feedback</h2>
        <p>Again, someone in the class will clone your repo and reproduce your work.  Also, they will send you some <a href="#feedback">helpful feedback</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="feedback">Tips for providing feedback</h2>
        <p>Twice in the course you will reproduce a peer's work and provide feedback. Your feedback should be constructive and specific. Here are examples for the kinds of things could be included in the feedback:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are the variable names clear?</li>
          <li>Is the logic of the code clear?</li>
          <li>Does the code have lots of copying-and-pasting?</li>
          <li>Are there parts of the code that should use loops or functions?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="requirements">Technical requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You must work with a partner.  Groups of three are also allowed if needed.</li>
          <li>You must use RMarkdown or LaTeX + knitr. This ensures that your code and your words are in the same place.</li>
          <li>You and your partner(s) must use github for project management and version control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Week 1: look for a paper and a partner</li>
          <li>End of Week 2 (Sunday, Feb 15, 2015): post to Piazza a <a href="#proposal">proposal</a> for your project</li>
          <li>Week 3: prepare template for reproduction</li>

          <li>Week 12: reproduce reproduction and extension created by a peer, and write a memo offering suggestions for how to improve</li>
          <li>Reading period: make improvements based on feedback</li>
          <li>Dean’s Date (Tuesday, May 12): submit final product</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

        <p>Your project proposal must be written in a structured format and must include each of the following elements:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Citation information for the paper you want to reproduce</li>
          <li>Summary of main results of the paper</li>
          <li>List of main statistical methods used</li>
          <li>List of datasets used</li>
          <li>Summary of data availability and data access plan</li>
          <li>Summary of code availability (code availability is not required)</li>
          <li>List of ideas for how the paper could be improved or extended (see here for ideas about what you can do <a href="#new">new</a>)</li>
          <li>Short explanation for why you and your partner picked this paper</li>
          <li>pdf copy of the paper</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you do not provide us with all of those elements, it will be hard for us to give you good advice.</p>
